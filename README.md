# Yahoo Finance Alerts

## About  

Pretty straight-forward script at the moment.  
This script will get some data from Yahoo Finance and send out alerts if prices are particularly low.  
You can modify the logic to do whatever you want though. Have fun.  

## Setup

**Rename fake_settings.json to settings.json.** This will make sure your credentials are ignored by git.  

If you're using a gmail account, you should be able to adjust the fake_settings.json file pretty easily.  
If you aren't using a gmail account, you'll need to make more modifications. Do some googling for smtplib if you need help. Or make a gmail account. Haha
